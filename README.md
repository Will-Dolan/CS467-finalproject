# CS467-finalproject
Final Project for CSCI467.

To run, 
- install all python packages in ```requirements.txt```
  - For this, we used a ```python3.11``` venv on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine and ran ```pip isntall -r requirements.txt```.
  - For other operating systems, create a python environment and install the same as above
- for all results, run the entire ```.ipynb``` file using your environment.
  - results may be slightly different than report, due to random seeding
