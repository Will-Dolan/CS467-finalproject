# CS467-finalproject
Final Project for CSCI467.

Both ```.ipynb``` files run the same scripts, but local_run is meant for running locally on a machine, and colab_run is meant for running on Google Colab. The following methods are how you can reproduce our code. Results might be slightly different than our report, but that would be due to random sampling. 

To run ```local_run```, 
- install all python packages in ```requirements.txt```
  - For this, we used a ```python3.11``` venv on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine and ran ```pip isntall -r requirements.txt```.
  - For other operating systems, create a python environment and install the same as above
- for all results, run the entire ```.ipynb``` file using your environment.

To run ```colab_run```,
- import the file into Google Colab
- run the cells in Google Colab
